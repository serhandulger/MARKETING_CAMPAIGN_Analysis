Analyzing Marketing Campaigns with Pandas - Part I (EDA & KPI Analysis)
One of the crucial thing while a data scientist & data analyst dealing with large dataset is using pandas library effectively. To be able to do this, every data scientist should be familiar enough with pandas packages, functions and its' capabilities as a fundamentals of data manipulation. In this study, we will practice translating common business questions into measurable outcomes by using a fake marketing dataset of an online subscription business via using mainly python pandas packages. Our study will answer the questions below for the related case study;
"How did this campaign perform"
"Which channel is referring the most subscribers"
"Why is particular channel is underperforming"
"What is the subscription pattern for different age groups and their tendencies" 

All of these questions above will be answered by data visualizations, cross data queries and manipulations by pandas. We will be creating new KPI's to be able to answer those questions. KPI analyzes are can be considered as an important part of CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Analytics as well. 
"A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effective a company is in achieving its core business goals. Organizations use KPIs at multiple levels to assess how well they are achieving their goals." www.inboxmailmarketing.com

Thus, determining the new KPI's and insights from the dataset, we will be setting new goals and deciding whether to change the marketing and CRM strategy. Especially, for the marketing terminology, we will be creating two main KPI's which are very important and common for marketing & CRM teams;
Conversion Rate
Retention Rate

In this study, we will be handling some of the common functions to manipulate the data with pandas like below;

 1) groupby()
 2) sum-count-median-mode() functions
 3) reset_index()
 4) unstack()
 5) to_frame()
 6) List comprehensions []
 7) map()
 8) np.where()
